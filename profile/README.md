# Welcome to CAT Camp!

We are a group of artist, makers, and dorks.  Our charter is to provide technical support and educational material to makers and artists.

In this repo we have collection of public  projects you are more than free to use for noncommercial purposes.

Our videos are on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy0ozVmlt_1guWCjFdro1DA).

If you need help with a project or are looking for (free) hardware to finish a project, email us at idiots AT thatcatcamp.com.

We are a 401(3)c organization - if you like what we do and want to donate hardware or your time, donations may be tax deductible, and your time may qualify for your employer's volunteer programs.
